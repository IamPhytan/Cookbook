# Jupyter Keymaps

Jupyter Notebook seems to work on a fork of [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/). The keyboard shortcuts used in Notebooks can be programmed using [CodeMirror commands](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#commands).

## Installation

To use keyboard shortcuts, one can implement functions in the configuration file situated at `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js`, as stated in [Jupyter Notebook's docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Custom%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.html#Keyboard-Shortcut-Customization-(Pre-Notebook-5.0)).
